## Database Seeding

The seeders have been successfully run and populated:

## Next Steps

The foundation is now ready for:
1. **Auction System**: Build bidding interface using the player statuses

## Testing

All components have been tested:
- Migrations run successfully
- Seeders populate data correctly
- Routes are properly registered
- Models have correct relationships
- Views render properly

The application is now ready for the next phase of development focusing on the auction system and additional team/player management features.
